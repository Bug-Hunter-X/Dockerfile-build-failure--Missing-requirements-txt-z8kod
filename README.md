This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failure to build due to a missing file referenced in the Dockerfile instructions. The original Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but the `requirements.txt` file is not included in the image build context. This leads to a build failure. The solution includes the necessary `requirements.txt` file, and verifies successful installation with a simple python script.
